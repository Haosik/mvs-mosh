**React application** with authorization, showing list of movies fetched from MongoDB/Express server ([/node-mvs-mosh](https://github.com/Haosik/node-mvs-mosh). [Heroku API](https://quiet-reaches-18919.herokuapp.com/api/movies)). Aims for clean code. Includes pagination, filtering, sorting, axios incerceptor, .env variables etc. Routing with [React Router 4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router). Form validation with [Joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi). Basic styling with bootstrap.

Frontend is based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
So `npm i`, `npm start`, `npm run build`.

Pushed to heroku with the help of [create-react-app-buildpack](https://elements.heroku.com/buildpacks/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).
